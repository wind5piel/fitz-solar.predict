# fritz!solar predict

The idea behind this project is to link the data generated by my little solarpower plant with other data, e.g. weather data.
On the one hand, correlations can be displayed graphically, on the other hand, predictions based on weather forecasts via ML should be possible in the future.

It is a personal project and is mainly for learning and practicing the techniques used.

## Project Steps

### Data

- [X] Ingest production from daily .csv-files into one production data file including datetime information.
- [ ] Ingest historical DWD weather data from nearby weather station

  - [ ] connect API
  - [ ] match data
- [ ] Connect to weather prognosis data for geoposition of power plant

### Visualization

* [ ] Display production data on daily/hourly basis, possibly interactively/Dashboard style
* [ ] include weather data into display options

### Machine Learning

* [ ] teach model on historical data (production, weather)

## Getting Started

The first step would be outside of this codebase: get a hold of the data.

For me it works like this: My power plant is connected to a smart socket which will send me an email every day containing a .csv-file with the day's production.
I set up an email filter that saves that attachment to my `data/prod_raw folder` from where the code takes over.``

## Trivia

The *fritz!solar* part of the name is meant as a homage to AVM whose products I use in collection my production data and who famously name their products fritz!something.
